# Concourse
A Discord bot that allows people to submit their schedule and compare it to others, as well as look up classes and their times and attendants. Currently, it's for UT, but if the the courses JSON file conforms to the definitions in `src/handlers.rs`, it should work just as well for other universities. All data is stored globally.
